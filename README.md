Linux 内核文档

This is the top level of the kernel’s documentation tree. Kernel documentation, like the kernel itself, is very much a work in progress; that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered documents into a coherent whole. Please note that improvements to the documentation are welcome; join the linux-doc list at vger.kernel.org if you want to help out.\
这是内核文档树的顶层。内核文档，就像内核本身一样，是一项正在进行中的工作;当我们努力将许多分散的文档整合到一个连贯的整体中时，请注意，欢迎改进文档;如果你想提供帮助，立即在 vger.kernel.org 加入 对应的 linux-doc list。
